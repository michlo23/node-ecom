## Goals
For the past few years, I have been mainly coding in the backend and .Net, and with this project, I want to explore unknown grounds. The project will be based on the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react.  Approaches and technologies I want to include in the project:
* Patterns to create scalable microservices for a variety of app domains
* Server-Side-Rendered React app using Hooks and Next JS
* Using JWT-based authentication
* Docker, Kubernetes
* Mongo, Redis
* Typescript
* React, NextJS


## How To Use
Requirements: 
* Docker Desktop with Kubernetes (Ingress installed)
* Skaffold
